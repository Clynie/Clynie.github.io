 The GFDL AM2.0 dynamical core is based on the Held-Suarez Forcing(1994). In designing the forcing and dissipation, we use simple Newtonian relaxation of the temperature field to a zonally symmetric state and Rayleigh damping of low-level winds to represent boundary-layer friction. Forcing GCMs in this way is relatively common, especially in two-layer models [Hendon and Hartmann (1985) and Suarez and Duffy (1992) are two examples. 

The first in the proposed series of benchmark calculations is described in this report

$$\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{t}}=...-k_{v}(\sigma)v$$

$$\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{t}}=...-k_{T}(\phi,\sigma)[T-T_{eq}(\phi,p)]$$

$$T_{eq}=max\{200K,[]\}$$

$$k_T=...$$

$$k_v=...$$

$$\sigma_b=...$$

$$k_f=...$$

The model is design for multi-core, but the single core is enough for T42 simulations. You need modify the `mkmf.template.ifc` in `./bin/` if you are using ifortran :

```bash
# mkmf -t template.ifc -c"-Duse_libMPI -Duse_netCDF" path_names /usr/local/include
FFLAGS = -stack_temps -safe_cray_ptr -ftz -i_dynamic \
	-assume byterecl -O2 -i4 -r8 -w95 \
	-I/opt/netcdf-3.6.3-intel/include
```

and the `fms.script` in `./exp/spectral/`

```bash
$mkmf -p fms.x -t $template -c "-Duse_netCDF" -a \
	$sourcedir $pathnames /usr/local/include \
	$sourcedir/shared/mpp/include $sourcedir/shared/include
```
