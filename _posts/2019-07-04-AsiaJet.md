title:  "Quantifying the dynamics of the interannual variabilities of the wintertime East Asian Jet Core"
date:   2019-07-04 12:15:26 +0800
excerpt: "The East Asian jet has evident interannual variability in strength and position and has broad impacts on weather and climate in the Asian-Pacific-American region. In this study, we quantify the relative contributions of distinct dynamical processes responsible for the wintertime interannual variability of the East Asian jet core. The quantification is based on analyzing the zonal momentum budgets. Our budget analyses show distinct up- and downstream controls for the interannual intensification of the jet. Over the upstream, the jet intensification is predominantly driven by enhanced upper-level angular momentum transport associated with local convective-driven Hadley-cells. In addition to convections over the Tropical Pacific, those over the Bay of Bengal–South China Sea are found responsible for a distinct local Hadley cell over 80◦–100◦ E, which accelerates the jet from its very upstream. Over the downstream, angular momentum advected by the mean flow from the upstream is the first-order term responsible for the jet intensification, whereas synoptic eddies play a secondary role. For the interannual meridional displacement of the jet, synoptic eddy activities over the North Pacific are found to contribute predominantly. For both the intensification and the meridional displacement, the upper-tropospheric jet covaries closely with changes in the Subtropical Oceanic Frontal Zone in the North Pacific. Such a strong covariation implies the contributions of the air–sea interactions to the downstream jet variability."

> Summary schematics of processes responsible for wintertime interannual variabilities of the East Asian jet. a An intensification of the jet is triggered by convections over the ’Bay of Bengal (BOB)– South China Sea (SCS) and Pacific Warm Pool over the upstream and maintained by feedback with Pacific Subtropical oceanfront through eddies over the downstream. b A poleward shift of the jet is mainly driven by eddies and is also coupled to the North Pacific subtropi- cal oceanic front. Black contours denote zonal-wind anomalies at the 200 hPa level associated with corresponding jet indices, as in Fig. 3a, b. Clouds and red circulations over the equatorial Indian Ocean and Western Pacific denote anomalous precipitations as well as two local MOCs detected in Fig. 5. Black arrows and shadings in the upper troposphere denote anomalous synoptic eddy activities (E-vectors and their divergence), as in Figs. 7 and 10. Color shadings at the surface are responses in wintertime oceanic fronts (meridional SST gradient)
