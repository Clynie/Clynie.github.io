A schematic diagram of LF EAPE budget. The shaded areas denote the action centers of LF energies (red for EAPE and yellow for EKE), with black thick dashed arrows denoting the baroclinic generation in the downstream region of storm tracks, purple arrows denoting diabatic damping, blue dashed arrows denoting energy transfer to HF EAPE via eddy-eddy interactions and green dashed arrows denoting energy conversion to LF EKE via baroclinic conversion term. The grey contours represent zonal winds in the upper level, with brown arrows denoting barotropic effect of divergence flow and magenta arrows denoting nonlinear interactions, which all act to transfer energy to LF EKE.
