title:  "Deep learning and process understanding for data-driven Earth system science"
date:   2020-02-17 19:05:26 +0800
excerpt: "Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to extract patterns and insights from the ever-increasing stream of geospatial data, but current approaches may not be optimal when system behaviour is dominated by spatial or temporal context. Here, rather than amending classical machine learning, we argue that these contextual cues should be used as part of deep learning (an approach that is able to extract spatio-temporal features automatically) to gain further process understanding of Earth system science problems, improving the predictive ability of seasonal forecasting and modelling of long-range spatial connections across multiple timescales, for example. The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning."

[Deep learning and process understanding for data-driven Earth system science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0912-1) is a review published in [《Nature》](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0912-1) as a [Perspectives](https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=perspective)

In the Paper, author review the development of machine learning in the geoscientific context, and highlight how deep learning—that is, the automatic extraction of abstract (spatio-temporal) features—has the potential to overcome many of the limitations that have, until now, hindered a more wide-spread adoption of machine learning. Author further lay out the most promising but also challenging approaches in combining machine learning with physical modelling.

首先文章介绍了地球系统的资料属于标准的__“Four V's”__ of __“Big Data”__:__Volume__(深度), __velocity__(更新速度), __Variety__(多样性), __Veracity__(真实性)。

紧接着文章提到了两个：“事实”：
1. 我们收集、创造数据的能力远远的超过我们能够明智的选择数据的能力，更别说理解它们。
2. 在过去几十年中，预测能力并没有随着数据的可用性的增加而增加。
